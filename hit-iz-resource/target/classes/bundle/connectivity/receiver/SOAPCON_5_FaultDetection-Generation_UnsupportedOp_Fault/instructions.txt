<li>The Tester configures the NIST Test Tool with Username, Password, FacilityID, and Endpoint information.</li>
<li>The Tester causes the NIST Test Tool to electronically generate and transmit to the System Under Test a SOAP message that conforms to the SOAP 1.2 standard but not the CDC WSDL 1.0 because it does not contain either a submitSingleMessage or a connectivityTest element</li>
<li>The Tester obtains the Juror Document for the Receiver SOAPCON_5_FaultDetection-Generation_UnsupportedOpFaults Test Case in the NIST Test Tool</li>
<li>The Tester uses the Juror Document to determine if the System Under Test received and processed the non-conformant SOAP request message correctly</li>
<li>The System Under Test electronically generates and transmits to the EHR-S Test Agent in the NIST Test Tool a SOAP response message UnsupportedOperationFault that conforms to the SOAP 1.2 standard and CDC WSDL 1.0 and that is used for transporting an appropriate HL7 fault response message to a sender (initiator) system</li>
<li>The Test Tool validates the SOAP response message for conformance to the SOAP 1.2 standard and CDC WSDL 1.0 </li>
<li>The Test Tool generates a Validation Report listing the results of the validation</li>
<li>The Tester reviews the Validation Report and compares the results to the Objectives and Evaluation Criteria associated with the Receiver SOAPCON_5_FaultDetection-Generation_UnsupportedOpFaults Test Case</li>
