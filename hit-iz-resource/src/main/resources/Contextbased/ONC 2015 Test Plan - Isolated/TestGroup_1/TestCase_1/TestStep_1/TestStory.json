  "teststorydesc" : "A two month old male infant, Russell Clinton Richardson, is brought to a clinic for a well child visit by his mother Maria Elizabeth Richardson (nee Billington) and his father John William Richardson. A clinic staff member collects basic patient demographic information including name, date of birth and sex. A clinic provider, Wilma Thomas (physician ID 654) reviews the patient's vaccination history and determines that the child previously received Hepatitis B vaccine 1 day after birth and 1 month after birth. The staff member determines that the patient needs DTaP, Hib, IPV, Rotavirus and Pneumococcal vaccinations. Because of the patient's status of Native American, he qualifies for all Vaccine For Children (VFC) supplied vaccines under the status of VFC eligible - American Indian/Alaska Native. The parents are given 5 Vaccine Information Sheets (VIS) to review. After reading them, they agree that the child should receive all the vaccinations recommended. They also agree that the data should be shared once it is incorporated into the local IIS. They indicate that reminders and recalls may be sent by any method. Appropriate doses of DTaP/Hib/IPV (Pentacel), Rotavirus (RotaTeq) and Pneumococcal (Prevnar 13) are selected from the clinic's stock of publically funded vaccines. A clinician, Lily Jackson (ID 7824) prepares and administers the doses to the patient and then enters the data into the EHR and transmits it to the IIS.",

  "notes" : "The NIST context-based testing performs specific content validation depending on the Category/Qualifier combination assigned to the Data Elements in the message (see How to Interpret the Message Content Data Sheet section for more details in the NIST Testing Process Document). In some cases, in order to perform this type of validation the NIST Tool expects the fields/segments/segment groups in the message to be sequenced in a certain order. The complexity of automatically evaluating specific content necessitates this approach. If the Message Validation Result generated by the NIST Tool indicates content-related errors (designated by Content-Test Case Assertion), the ATL may change the order of the fields/segments/segment groups in the test message (created by the System-under Test-SUT) to match the Test Case once the message has been loaded into the Message Content Edit window of the Test Tool. These kinds of content-related errors do not imply a failure of the SUT nor a requirement to create the message with the segments/segment groups in a certain order (beyond the base message structure). See associated documentation in the tool documentation tab for more detials.<br><div><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;\">For new administration messages, the vaccine is communicated using\r\nNDC codes in RXA-5 (Administered Code). For a given vaccine, one or more NDC\r\ncodes may be appropriate to message. For this reason, RXA-5.1 is categorized as\r\n\"Value - Test Case Fixed List\" and allows for multiple valid values. The\r\nMessage Content and Example Message data contain a single representative valid\r\nNDC code for example purposes.<o:p></o:p></p></div>"
