  "teststorydesc" : "<p>A two month old male infant, Russell Clinton Richardson, is brought to the West Clinic for a well child visit by his mother Maria Elizabeth Richardson (nee Billington) and his father John William Richardson. A clinic staff member collects basic patient demographic information including name, date of birth and sex. A clinic provider, Wilma Thomas (physician ID 654) reviews the patient&rsquo;s vaccination history and determines that the child previously received Hepatitis B vaccine 1 day after birth and 1 month after birth. The staff member determines that the patient needs DTaP, Hib, IPV, Rotavirus and Pneumococcal vaccinations. Because of the patient&rsquo;s status of Native American, he qualifies for all Vaccine For Children (VFC) supplied vaccines under the status of VFC eligible &ndash; American Indian/Alaska Native. The parents are given 5 Vaccine Information Sheets (VIS) to review. After reading them, they agree that the child should receive all the vaccinations recommended. They also agree that the data should be shared once it is incorporated into the local IIS. Appropriate doses of DTaP/Hib/IPV (Pentacel), Rotavirus (RotaTeq) and Pneumococcal (Prevnar 13) are selected from the clinic&rsquo;s stock of publically funded vaccines. A clinician, Lily Jackson (ID 7824) prepares and administers the doses to the patient and then enters the data into the EHR and transmits it to the IIS.</p>\r\n",
