  "testObjectives" : "<span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Select New Patient:</span></span>\r\n The system must allow a user to enter distinguishing information about \r\npatients so that providers can uniquely identify patients who have \r\nsimilar sounding names or other similar identifying information.  For \r\nexample, twins living in the same household will have similar dates of \r\nbirth, addresses, and may have similar names. EHRs or other clinical \r\nsoftware must be able to store information to successfully match with \r\npatients in immunization registries, if the information is available. \r\nThe information includes the mother's maiden name, whether the patient \r\nwas part of a multiple birth, and the order of the multiple birth. This \r\ninformation allows the provider to correctly identify the patient and \r\nalso helps assure a match when the EHR send the patient's information to\r\n external systems such as an immunization registry.<br><br></span>Real Time Request/Receive Patient Immunization History: </span><span style=\"font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;\">The system sends a request to the public health immunization registry \"on demand\" (e.g., those without scheduled appointments). The request includes the identifying information the immunization registry needs to match each patient with those in the registry including, if present, the mother's maiden name, a multiple birth indicator, and the birth order. The request also is sent in a pre-determined format the registry can read and interpret (Query Response Grammar (RSP) - HL7 version 2.5.1 Implementation Guide for Immunization Messaging Release 1.5).<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Compare Public Health Immunization Registry (IIS) Immunization History to EHR Immunization History:</span></span> The public health immunization registry has returned the requested immunization history for a patient. The EHR is able to display the immunization history received from the registry as well as the immunization history already present in the EHR so that a user can compare them.  The EHR provides a way for the provider to view both histories, determine what is different (if anything), and update the existing EHR immunization history with new information from the public health registry if he or she chooses to do so. The system must store the new information as structured data as part of the patient's local immunization history and include the time of the update and the source of the new information.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Request/Receive Patient Immunization Data and Identify Source:</span></span> The EHR or other clinical software is able to store immunization history accepted electronically from other sources (such as a public health immunization registry consistent with HL7 version 2.5.1, Implementation Guide for Immunization Messaging Release 1.5) or communicated by the patient and manually entered by the clinician. When viewing such information, the provider can determine which immunizations were administered by the practice, which were entered manually as patient-reported, and which were accepted electronically from the public health registry.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">View Immunization Forecast:</span></span> The system provides a view of the immunization forecast provided by the public health immunization registry (IIS).  The display includes the forecast from the registry and includes recommended vaccination dates, minimum (earliest) date, ideal date, and maximum (latest) date for each vaccine included in the forecast.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">View Reconciled Immunization Forecast:</span></span> The EHR or other clinical software system has the ability to re-evaluate and update the immunization forecast using a patient's newly updated immunization history, where the updated forecast results from the reconciliation of immunization data contained in the public health immunization registry with immunization data contained in the EHR. Processing the new forecast can be internal to the EHR or it can use an external forecasting service.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Review Patient Immunization History:</span></span> To assist with the ordering process, the EHR or other clinical software system allows a user to specify standard views of patient immunization information for each vaccine dose administration, including patient-specific data (e.g., age on dates of administration, etc.).<br><br>Support for:<br></span><span style=\"font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Receive Dose Not Indicated Alert for Single Vaccine Order:</span></span>\r\n The EHR or other clinical software system notifies the provider in \r\ninstances when there are single or combination vaccine orders that are \r\ninconsistent with the expected timing intervals included in the vaccine \r\nforecast. Inconsistencies include suggestion of different date(s) for \r\nordering the vaccine(s) or indication the vaccine(s) is/are no longer \r\nrequired.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"></span></span></span><br>",
