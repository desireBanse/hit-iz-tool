For \r\nexample, twins living in the same household will have similar dates of \r\nbirth, addresses, and may have similar names. EHRs or other clinical \r\nsoftware must be able to store information to successfully match with \r\npatients in immunization registries, if the information is available. \r\nThe information includes the mother's maiden name, whether the patient \r\nwas part of a multiple birth, and the order of the multiple birth. This \r\ninformation allows the provider to correctly identify the patient and \r\nalso helps assure a match when the EHR send the patient's information to\r\n external systems such as an immunization registry.<br><br></span>Real Time Request/Receive Patient Immunization History: </span><span style=\"font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;\">The\r\n system sends a request to the public health immunization registry \"on \r\ndemand\" (e.g., those without scheduled appointments). The request \r\nincludes the identifying information the immunization registry needs to \r\nmatch each patient with those in the registry including, if present, the\r\n mother's maiden name, a multiple birth indicator, and the birth order. \r\nThe request also is sent in a pre-determined format the registry can \r\nread and interpret (Query Response Grammar (RSP) - HL7 version 2.5.1 \r\nImplementation Guide for Immunization Messaging Release 1.5).<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Request/Receive Patient Immunization Data and Identify Source:</span></span>\r\n The EHR or other clinical software is able to store immunization \r\nhistory accepted electronically from other sources (such as a public \r\nhealth immunization registry consistent with HL7 version 2.5.1, \r\nImplementation Guide for Immunization Messaging Release 1.5) or \r\ncommunicated by the patient and manually entered by the clinician. When \r\nviewing such information, the provider can determine which immunizations\r\n were administered by the practice, which were entered manually as \r\npatient-reported, and which were accepted electronically from the public\r\n health registry.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">View Immunization Forecast:</span></span>\r\n The system provides a view of the immunization forecast provided by the\r\n public health immunization registry (IIS).  The display includes the \r\nforecast from the registry and includes recommended vaccination dates, \r\nminimum (earliest) date, ideal date, and maximum (latest) date for each \r\nvaccine included in the forecast.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">View Reconciled Immunization Forecast:</span></span>\r\n The EHR or other clinical software system has the ability to \r\nre-evaluate and update the immunization forecast using a patient's newly\r\n updated immunization history, where the updated forecast results from \r\nthe reconciliation of immunization data contained in the public health \r\nimmunization registry with immunization data contained in the EHR. \r\nProcessing the new forecast can be internal to the EHR or it can use an \r\nexternal forecasting service.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Review Patient Immunization History:</span></span>\r\n To assist with the ordering process, the EHR or other clinical software\r\n system allows a user to specify standard views of patient immunization \r\ninformation for each vaccine dose administration, including \r\npatient-specific data (e.g., age on dates of administration, etc.).<br><br>Support for:<br></span><span style=\"font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Receive Dose Not Indicated Alert for Single Vaccine Order:</span></span>\r\n The EHR or other clinical software system notifies the provider in \r\ninstances when there are single or combination vaccine orders that are \r\ninconsistent with the expected timing intervals included in the vaccine \r\nforecast. Inconsistencies include suggestion of different date(s) for \r\nordering the vaccine(s) or indication the vaccine(s) is/are no longer \r\nrequired.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"></span></span></span>",
