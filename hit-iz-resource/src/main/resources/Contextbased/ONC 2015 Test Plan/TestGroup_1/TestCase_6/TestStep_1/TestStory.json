For certification purposes, ONC permits Testers to ignore the error notification generated by the NIST Immunization Test Suite when this segment is missing.  Since the product under test will have to meet state reporting requirements when implemented, and many states require this information, it may be beneficial for HIT Modules to demonstrate support for the Vaccine Funding Source OBX segment during 2015 Edition certification testing. </p></div>"
