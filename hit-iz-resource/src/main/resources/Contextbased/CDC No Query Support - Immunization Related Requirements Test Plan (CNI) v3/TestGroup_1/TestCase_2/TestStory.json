For example, twins living in the same household will have similar dates of birth, addresses, and may have similar names. EHRs or other clinical software must be able to store information to successfully match with patients in immunization registries, if the information is available. The information includes the mother's maiden name, whether the patient was part of a multiple birth, and the order of the multiple birth. This information allows the provider to correctly identify the patient and also helps assure a match when the EHR send the patient's information to external systems such as an immunization registry.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Record Past Immunizations: </span></span>The EHR or other clinical software system allows providers to enter information about immunizations given elsewhere (e.g., by another doctor, at a public health clinic, pharmacy, etc.) with incomplete details.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Request/Receive Patient Immunization Data and Identify Source:</span></span> The EHR or other clinical software is able to store immunization history accepted electronically from other sources (such as a public health immunization registry consistent with HL7 version 2.5.1, Implementation Guide for Immunization Messaging Release 1.5) or communicated by the patient and manually entered by the clinician.
