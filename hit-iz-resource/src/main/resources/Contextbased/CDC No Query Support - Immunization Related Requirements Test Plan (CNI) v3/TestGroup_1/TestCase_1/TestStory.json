For example, twins living in the same household will have similar dates of birth, addresses, and may have similar names. EHRs or other clinical software must be able to store information to successfully match with patients in immunization registries, if the information is available. The information includes the mother's maiden name, whether the patient was part of a multiple birth, and the order of the multiple birth.

The EHR provides a way for the provider to view both histories, determine what is different (if anything), and update the existing EHR immunization history with new information from the public health registry if he or she chooses to do so.
