The request also is sent in a pre-determined format the registry can read and interpret (Query Response Grammar (RSP) - HL7 version 2.5.1 Implementation Guide for Immunization Messaging Release 1.5).</em></p><p><em><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Compare Public Health Immunization Registry (IIS) Immunization History to EHR Immunization History:</span> </em>The public health immunization registry has returned the requested immunization history for a patient. The EHR is able to display the immunization history received from the registry as well as the immunization history already present in the EHR so that a user can compare them.  The EHR provides a way for the provider to view both histories, determine what is different (if anything), and update the existing EHR immunization history with new information from the public health registry if he or she chooses to do so. The system must store the new information as structured data as part of the patient's local immunization history and include the time of the update and the source of the new information.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 10pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: normal;\"> </div>\r\n\r\n<div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><em>Review Patient Immunization History:</em></span> To assist with the ordering process, the EHR or other clinical software system allows a user to specify standard views of patient immunization information for each vaccine dose administration, including patient-specific data (e.g., age on dates of administration, etc.).</div>\r\n",
