<ul>
<li>The System Under Test (SUT) generates a SOAP submitSingleMessageResponse message envelope
<li>The Tester copies this SOAP submitSingleMessageResponse message envelope and pastes it into the Test Tool, which is functioning as the initiator system (e.g., EHR-S)
<li>The Test Tool validates the SOAP submitSingleMessageResponse message envelope for conformance to the SOAP 1.2 standard and CDC WSDL 1.0
<li>The Test Tool generates a Validation Report listing the results of the validation
<li>The Tester reviews the Validation Report and compares the results to the Objectives and Evaluation Criteria associated with the SOAPENV_2_SubmitSingleMessage_Response Test Case
